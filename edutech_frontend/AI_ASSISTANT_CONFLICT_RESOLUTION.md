# AI Assistant and Highlighting/Note Conflict Resolution

## Problem Summary
The AI Assistant popup was appearing automatically when users selected text, which created a conflict with the existing highlighting and note-taking functionality. Users couldn't create highlights or notes because the AI popup would immediately appear and block access to the sidebar note form.

## Root Cause
Both features were triggered by the same `onMouseUp` event:
- **AI Assistant**: Automatically showed popup when text was selected
- **Highlighting/Notes**: Required text selection to work with the SidebarNoteForm
- **Conflict**: AI popup appeared immediately, preventing users from accessing highlight/note creation tools

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Mode-Based System
Added a toggle system that allows users to choose between two modes:

**ü§ñ AI Assistant Mode**
- Text selection triggers AI assistance popup
- Provides 5 AI actions: Explanation, Summary, Translate, Study Questions

**üìù Highlight/Note Mode** 
- Text selection populates the sidebar form for creating highlights and notes
- AI popup does not appear, allowing uninterrupted note-taking workflow

### 2. User Interface Changes

#### Mode Toggle Button
```tsx
<Button
  variant={aiMode ? "default" : "outline"}
  onClick={() => setAIMode(!aiMode)}
  className={aiMode ? "bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700" : ""}
>
  <Eye className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
  {aiMode ? "AI Assistant: ON" : "AI Assistant: OFF"}
</Button>
```

#### Visual Mode Indicator
- **AI Mode**: Blue badge with ü§ñ AI Assistant Mode
- **Highlight Mode**: Green badge with üìù Highlight/Note Mode
- Real-time visual feedback in the lesson content header

#### Instructional Text
- Dynamic help text showing what will happen when text is selected
- Keyboard shortcut instruction: `Ctrl+Shift+A` to toggle modes

### 3. Enhanced UX Features

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+Shift+A**: Toggle between AI and highlight/note modes
- **Escape**: Close AI Assistant popup

#### Smart Mode Switching
- After AI assistance is provided, automatically switches to highlight/note mode
- Preserves text selection so users can create notes about the AI assistance
- Smooth workflow: Get AI help ‚Üí Create note about it

#### Selection Preservation
- Modified AI assistant close handler to preserve text selection
- Users can get AI assistance, then immediately create highlights/notes
- No need to re-select text

### 4. Code Changes Made

#### File: `src/pages/LessonDetailPage.tsx`

**Added State Management:**
```tsx
const [aiMode, setAIMode] = useState(false) // Toggle between modes
```

**Updated Text Selection Handler:**
```tsx
// Only show AI assistant if in AI mode and text is selected
if (aiMode && selectionData && selectionData.selectedText.trim().length > 0) {
  // Show AI popup
} else if (!aiMode && selectionData && selectionData.selectedText.trim().length > 0) {
  // Allow highlight/note creation
}
```

**Enhanced UI Components:**
- Mode toggle button in action bar
- Visual mode indicator in lesson content header
- Dynamic help text and keyboard shortcuts
- Keyboard event handlers for shortcuts
