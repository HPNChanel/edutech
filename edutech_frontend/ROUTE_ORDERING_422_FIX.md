# Route Ordering 422 Error Fix

## Problem
The bulk delete endpoint was returning a 422 Unprocessable Entity error instead of processing requests correctly.

## Root Cause: FastAPI Route Ordering
The issue was caused by **route ordering** in the FastAPI router. The routes were defined in this order:

```python
# WRONG ORDER (causing 422 errors)
@router.delete("/conversations/{conversation_id}")  # This came first
@router.delete("/conversations/bulk")               # This came second
```

When a request was made to `/api/chat/conversations/bulk`, FastAPI would:
1. Try to match the first route `/conversations/{conversation_id}`
2. Attempt to parse "bulk" as an integer for `conversation_id`
3. Fail validation because "bulk" is not a valid integer
4. Return 422 Unprocessable Entity

## Solution: Reorder Routes
The fix was to place **specific routes before parameterized routes**:

```python
# CORRECT ORDER (working properly)
@router.delete("/conversations/bulk")               # Specific route first
@router.delete("/conversations/{conversation_id}")  # Parameterized route second
```

## Why This Works
FastAPI matches routes in the order they are defined. By putting the specific `/conversations/bulk` route before the parameterized `/conversations/{conversation_id}` route, FastAPI correctly matches requests to `/conversations/bulk` without attempting to parse "bulk" as an integer.

## Files Modified
- `edutech_backend/app/routers/chat.py` - Moved bulk delete route definition before individual delete route

## Testing Results
After the fix:
- ✅ Valid requests with authentication: Return proper response or 401/403 for auth issues
- ✅ Invalid JSON: Returns 422 (correct validation error)
- ✅ Missing authentication: Returns 401/403 (correct auth error)
- ✅ No more spurious 422 errors for valid requests

## Key Takeaway
**In FastAPI, always define specific routes before parameterized routes to avoid path parameter validation conflicts.**

This is a common gotcha in FastAPI route definition and explains why the backend was rejecting perfectly valid request formats.
